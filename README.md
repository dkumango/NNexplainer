# NNexplainer

NNexplainer is a library designed to explain prediction results generated by neural network-based models. Currently, it supports only tabular input data; image or text data cannot be explained yet.

Examples demonstrating the prediction results of regression and classification models are provided in the files NNexplain_regression.ipynb(regression.ipynb) and NNexplain_classification.ipynb( NNexplain_classification.ipynb)
